    <h1>linear equationes</h1>
    <pre>an equatione that has maximum degree one is known as linear equation. the graph of it is a straight line.

for example
    </pre>
    <ul>
        <li>y=8x-2</li>
        <li>ax<sub>1</sub>+ bx<sub>2</sub>- cx<sub>3</sub>= 9</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
are some if the exampls of linear equation in two and three variables

slop of intersection of two linear equation linear equation
y<sub>1</sub>=mx<sub>1</sub>+ a and
y<sub>2</sub>=mx<sub>2</sub>+ b
for the points <b>P</b>(x<sub>1</sub>, y <sub>1</sub>)is:
<b>m =(y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub>- x<sub>1</sub>)</b>
